# mGENRE_MEL
This repository contains files and materials related to multilingual entity linking task (MEL), especially basing on the mGENRE model since it is SOTA model. We consider MEL as a part of big knowledge base question answering (KBQA) that is called information retrieval part. Within this part we retrieve entities. Basing on them we can make queries to knowledge base. Thus, we obtain KBQA system

This repository is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12528 where mGENRE model is proposed.
